    <h2>What Makes Chocolate Covered Strawberry Cupcakes So Good?</h2>
    <p>
      These do take a top stop for one of my favorite cupcakes.It&rsquo;s just a
      perfect flavor combination. Rich and sweet and perfectly satisfying. And
      sure to curb those chocolate cravings! I was savoring every bite of these.
      They are dreamy in every way!
    </p>

      The cupcakes themselves are my favorite chocolate cupcakes, they
      aren&rsquo;t overly fluffy and airy cupcakes. They have the perfect
      density to them. And they&rsquo;re perfectly moist. And they have just the
      right amount of chocolate flavor (coming from both real chocolate and
      cocoa powder). Their chocolate intensity is something between milk
      chocolate and dark. Then that frosting. Oh, don&rsquo;t even get me
      started!

    <h2>The Strawberry Buttercream Frosting</h2>
    <p>
      I actually combined two of my strawberry buttercream frosting recipes this
      time around (this one with real strawberries and this one with
      freeze-dried). So why did I do that? It sounds like too much work, right?
      Well, each on their own didn&rsquo;t have enough strawberry flavor to go
      up against the bold flavor of chocolate. So together with freeze-dried
      strawberries and reduced fresh strawberries, you get the best strawberry
      frosting this world has ever known. Seriously. The frosting is bursting
      with an abundance of strawberry flavor! It&rsquo;s like eating a
      strawberry that turned into frosting. And yes it takes work and time to
      make it between the different steps and everything but it&rsquo;s so worth
      it!
    </p>
    <h2>A Seedless Frosting is Key</h2>
    <p>
      I even went the extra mile and strained out the seeds because we are going
      for a perfect cupcake here. So don&rsquo;t skip that step for a lusciously
      smooth seedless frosting. I already bought another bag of freeze-dried
      strawberries to make another batch soon. I&rsquo;m thinking
      Valentine&rsquo;s Day but we&rsquo;ll see if I can wait that long. In case
      you were wondering, you can usually find freeze-dried strawberries in
      pouches in the produce section of grocery stores and sometimes by the
      raisins. You can also buy them in a big container on Amazon and they are
      great for snacking! I have 6 of those cans in my food storage
