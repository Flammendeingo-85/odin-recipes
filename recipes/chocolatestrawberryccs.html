    <h2>What Makes Chocolate Covered Strawberry Cupcakes So Good?</h2>
    <p>
      These do take a top stop for one of my favorite cupcakes.It&rsquo;s just a
      perfect flavor combination. Rich and sweet and perfectly satisfying. And
      sure to curb those chocolate cravings! I was savoring every bite of these.
      They are dreamy in every way!
    </p>
    <p>
      The cupcakes themselves are my favorite chocolate cupcakes, they
      aren&rsquo;t overly fluffy and airy cupcakes. They have the perfect
      density to them. And they&rsquo;re perfectly moist. And they have just the
      right amount of chocolate flavor (coming from both real chocolate and
      cocoa powder). Their chocolate intensity is something between milk
      chocolate and dark. Then that frosting. Oh, don&rsquo;t even get me
      started!
    </p>
    <h2>The Strawberry Buttercream Frosting</h2>
    <p>
      I actually combined two of my strawberry buttercream frosting recipes this
      time around (this one with real strawberries and this one with
      freeze-dried). So why did I do that? It sounds like too much work, right?
      Well, each on their own didn&rsquo;t have enough strawberry flavor to go
      up against the bold flavor of chocolate. So together with freeze-dried
      strawberries and reduced fresh strawberries, you get the best strawberry
      frosting this world has ever known. Seriously. The frosting is bursting
      with an abundance of strawberry flavor! It&rsquo;s like eating a
      strawberry that turned into frosting. And yes it takes work and time to
      make it between the different steps and everything but it&rsquo;s so worth
      it!
    </p>
    <h2>A Seedless Frosting is Key</h2>
    <p>
      I even went the extra mile and strained out the seeds because we are going
      for a perfect cupcake here. So don&rsquo;t skip that step for a lusciously
      smooth seedless frosting. I already bought another bag of freeze-dried
      strawberries to make another batch soon. I&rsquo;m thinking
      Valentine&rsquo;s Day but we&rsquo;ll see if I can wait that long. In case
      you were wondering, you can usually find freeze-dried strawberries in
      pouches in the produce section of grocery stores and sometimes by the
      raisins. You can also buy them in a big container on Amazon and they are
      great for snacking! I have 6 of those cans in my food storage

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>For the cupcakes:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with cupcake
        liners. Melt chocolate in a microwave safe bowl on 50% power in 20
        second intervals, stirring between intervals until melted and smooth,
        set aside to cool slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and
        salt for 20 seconds, set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl using an electric hand mixer mix together sugar
        and butter until combined (it won't come together entirely but mix until
        lumps of butter are creamed).
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in egg, egg yolk and vanilla extract. Mix in melted chocolate then
        mix in sour cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add half of the flour mixture and mix on low speed until combined then
        add remaining half and mix until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add about 1/5 of the boiling water at a time, mixing until combined
        after each addition. Once water has all been blended mix batter on
        medium-low speed for 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add about 1/5 of the boiling water at a time, mixing until combined
        after each addition. Once water has all been blended mix batter on
        medium-low speed for 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from oven, transfer to a wire rack and cool 10 minutes, then
        transfer to an airtight container (one that doesn't touch tops. I like
        to do this to seal in moisture) and allow to cool completely before
        frosting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once cool frost with strawberry buttercream frosting and top with a
        chocolate covered strawberry. Store in an airtight container in
        refrigerator (for best results serve within the day at room
        temperature).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the strawberry frosting:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place freeze dried strawberries in a small resealable bag, seal bag and
        crush strawberries to a fine powder with a rolling pin. Sift through a
        fine mesh sieve into a bowl to remove seeds, set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain strawberry puree through a fine mesh sieve and measure out 3/4
        cup, then pour into a small saucepan set over medium-low heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simmer puree, stirring occasionally until reduced by about two thirds to
        a 1/4 cup, about 10 - 14 minutes (measure and if it isn't quite 1/4 cup
        then return and continue to simmer, if it's not reduced to correct
        amount it will make the frosting runny).
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour reduced puree into a small bowl, then freeze or refrigerate,
        stirring occasionally until fully cooled.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle
        attachment, whip butter until pale and fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in powdered sugar, reduced strawberry puree, freeze dried strawberry
        powder, lemon juice, and vanilla and continue to mix until frosting is
        pale and fluffy. Tint with color if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the chocolate covered strawberries:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt chocolate in a small microwave safe bowl on 50% power in 30 second
        increments, stirring between intervals, until melted and smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip strawberries in chocolate, let excess run off then transfer one to
        each cupcake.
