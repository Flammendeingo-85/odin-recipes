    <h2>Fun History About Apple Pie</h2>
    <p>
      This Dutch Apple Pie is my all-time favorite apple pie! Made with a flaky
      homemade pie crust, a deliciously flavorful apple pie filling and it’s
      finished with a sweet and buttery streusel crumb topping. Pie doesn’t get
      any better than this!
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you know the first apple pie dates back to a recipe recorded in
      England in 1381 (source)? It included apples, pears, raisins, figs and
      saffron. Looks like this dessert has evolved quite a bit, coming in many
      variations around the globe. But I think it&rsquo;s a timeless dessert
      that will stick around for many more centuries to come. It&rsquo;s just
      that good! And the first authentic Dutch apple pie dates back to a
      cookbook from the year 1514 (source). It was baked in a Dutch oven pan,
      made with a standard pie crust, soft apples and lots of spices. It also
      included what we would now view as an odd method: removing top pie crust
      partway through baking and pressing the baked pie filling through a sieve,
      then stirring the pie with a wooden spoon and adding cream and baking to
      dry. How pie has changed

    <h2>Ingredients for Dutch Apple Pie from Scratch</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Unbleached all-purpose flour: This is used in each layer, the crust, the
        filling and the topping. Preferably used unbleached over bleached for
        best flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Granulated sugar and brown sugar: These sugars sweeten the pie, without
        it it wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a dessert.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt: Add this to build some flavor in the crust and a hint in the
        topping.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unsalted butter: Here&rsquo;s another ingredient thats added to all
        three layers of the pie. Because butter makes the best pies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Vanilla extract: You&rsquo;ll be dreaming about this vanilla flavored
        crumb topping. Don&rsquo;t skip the vanilla.
      </li>
      <li>
        Apples: Preferably use a blend of golden delicious and granny smith.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lemon: This brightens up the flavor of the apple layer and reduces
        browning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cinnamon and nutmeg: What would apple pie be without that warm cinnamon
        spice? I also love a hint of nutmeg too because why not?
      </li>
      <li>
        Ice water: using very cold water helps ensure butter doesn&rsquo;t
        soften and pie crust ends up tender and flaky.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Make Dutch Apple Pie:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare and blind bake pie crust: This will include preparing the dough,
        chilling, rolling and shaping in a pie dish, then chilling again, and
        blind baking. It’s a process but so worth it!
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the crumb topping: In a mixing bowl you’ll mix brown sugar, flour,
        nutmeg and salt. Then add in melted butter and vanilla mixture and stir
        to moisten. Chill.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the apple pie filling: In a large mixing bowl toss sliced apples
        with remaining 2 Tbsp melted butter and lemon juice. Add sugar, 3 Tbsp
        flour, and cinnamon and toss.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble pie: Layer a handful or two of apple mixture into the pie
        dish at a time, spreading and pressing into an even layer and turning
        slices flat. Top with crumble.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake: Place the pie on a rimmed baking sheet, bake until apples are
        almost fully tender when poked with a toothpick about 45 – 55 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let cool to warm: Remove pie from oven and let cool on a wire rack (it
        will take about 2 hours of cooling). Serve just warm with vanilla ice
        cream if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
